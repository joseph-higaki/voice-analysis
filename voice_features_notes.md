# Vocal Concepts

## [Paralanguage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralanguage)
Metacomunnication that modify textual meaning by prosody, pitch, volume, intonation

## [Loudness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness) 
Subjective perceptino of sound pressure:

Pa and [dB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel)
are units of pressure
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Sound_pressure_level 

## [Prosody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics))
Study of elements that are not individual phnetic segments (vowels, consonants)
Properties of syllables
Attributes of Prosody

### [Speech Tempo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_tempo)
Number of speech units within a given amount of time

Most commonly measured in Words Per Minute WPM 
Also Sounds per Second
- 9.4 sounds per second for poetry reading 
- 13.83 per second for sports commentary

## [Intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics))
Variation in pitch to indicate speaker's attitude and emotions

## [Isochrony or Rythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrony)
Language feature
Rhytmic division of time into equal portions by a language
["French, Telugu and Yoruba ... are syllable-timed languages, ... English, Russian and Arabic ... are stress-timed languages."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrony#cite_note-8)

Three ways to divide languge over time
1. Syllable timed (French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Brazilian Portuguese, Icelandic, Singlish,[14][15][16] Cantonese, Mandarin Chinese, Armenian, Turkish and Korean[)
2. Mora timed (time equal or shorter to a syllable): Japanese, Gilbertese, Slovak and Ganda
3. Stress timed: English, Thai, Lao, German, Russian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Faroese, Dutch, European Portuguese

## [Stress]()
Means of making a syllable, words or part of tha sentence prominent
### [Prosodic Stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)#Prosodic_stress)
Emphasizing words or ideas 
- **I didn't** take the test yesterday. (Somebody else did.)
- I **didn't** take the test yesterday. (I did not take it.)
- I didn't **take** the test yesterday. (I did something else with it.)
- I didn't take **the** test yesterday. (I took one of several, or I didn't take the specific test that would have been implied.)
- I didn't take the **test** yesterday. (I took something else.)
- I didn't take the test **yesterday**. (I took it some other day.)

Stress is can be executed by:
* Pitch variation
* Increased duration
* Increased Loudness
* Timbre differences???

## Pause
Interruption of sound
Can convey hesitation, importane
* Filled Pauses (eh, uh)
* Paralingual pauses (sighs)

## Chunking 
Pattern of pausing of lack of pausing:
* "You know what I mean?" - "No wada meeen?"
* "y lo sabes" - "ylosaes"

## [Timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre)
Preceived osound quality
UNIQUE for voices
